Why Cofi?

I've built Cofi after getting frustrated with the lack of privacy-respecting, small, and fast, timers. None of the other timers could be used in the way, that I want to use them. So here it is! Cofi completly open, fast timer that does only what it needs and nothing more.

Features:

- No artificial limits - create any recipe you want, no matter how outrageous it's going to be,
- Deeplinks to recipes - you can add it to automation software or NFC tag to open your favorite recipe with one tap,
- Picture in Picture - need to respond to a text while brewing? The timer will pop into small movable windows that will stay with you for the entire brew,
- Absolutely no tracking - not even a crash report will make its way back to me. Everything you do in the app stays with you,
- Smallest footprint possible - I'm going to be surprised if it ever breaks 7MB on your device
- Instant app - the whole app is accessible as an Instant Experience, no need to install anything if you don't want it.
