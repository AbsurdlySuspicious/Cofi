# Why Cofi?

I've built Cofi after getting frustrated with the lack of privacy-respecting, small, and fast, timers. None of the apps in the Play Store could be used in the way, that I want to use them. Additionally, it was a great way to try out _new_ Android development ways, like: **Jetpack Compose**, **DataStore**, and build features that I've never done before.

## Features:

- **No artificial limits** - create any recipe you want, no matter how outrageous it might seem,
- **Deeplinks to recipes** - you can add it to automation software or NFC tag to open your favorite recipe with one tap,
- **Picture in Picture** - need to respond to a text while brewing? The timer will pop into small movable windows that will stay with you for the entire brew,
- **Absolutely no tracking** - not even a crash report will make its way back to me. Everything you do in the app stays with you,
- **Smallest footprint possible** - I'm going to be surprised if it ever breaks 7MB on your device
- **Instant app (Google Play Store only)** - the whole app is accessible as an Instant Experience, no need to install anything if you don't want it.

## How it looks?
