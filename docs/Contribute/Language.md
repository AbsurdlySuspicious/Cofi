# Contribute new language

If you are familiar with the Android resource structure I'll be happy to accept Pull Request with a new language to Cofi!
You can find always up to date English strings [here](app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml)

If you don't know how to do any of the things I've mentioned above:

- Open [English strings](app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml)
- Copy everything to your editor of choice
- Translate stuff that's between `<string name="">` and `</string>`
- Open Issue on GitHub and paste your translation there. Remember to add information about what language it is!
- Or if you don't have a GitHub account, use the contact form in the app to send me the file
